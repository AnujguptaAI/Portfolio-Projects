## Description

The HR department of **QuantifyTech** approached a data analytics firm to gain comprehensive insights into employee attendance patterns over a specified period at their 
head office. With plans to introduce a bonus program and allocate a health insurance budget for their consistently healthy employees, the HR team aims to establish 
clear criteria for bonus distribution. Additionally, they seek to understand the underlying causes and trends in absenteeism to make informed decisions and improve 
overall workforce well-being.
