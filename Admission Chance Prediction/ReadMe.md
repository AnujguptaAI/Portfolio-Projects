# Admission Chance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
## Dataset: Student Admission Records

### Description:
The dataset comprises a collection of student records pertaining to university admissions. Each record contains a comprehensive set of attributes that potentially influence 
admission decisions. These attributes include:

GRE Score: Graduate Record Examination score.
TOEFL Score: Test of English as a Foreign Language score.
CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average.
Research: A binary indicator specifying whether the applicant has research experience (1) or not (0).
LOR: Letter of Recommendation rating.0-5
SOP: Statement of Purpose rating.0-5
Chance of Admit: A numerical value representing the estimated probability of admission to the university.
This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models to assess a student's likelihood of admission based on the provided criteria.

## Objective 
The objective is to construct a multiple linear regression model that utilizes various student attributes as input variables to predict the probability of admission to the university.
