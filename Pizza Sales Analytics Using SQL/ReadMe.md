# Slice Delight Pizzeria Sales Analysis
## Overview
Slice Delight Pizzeria, established in 2010, has become a beloved staple in the heart of downtown Springfield. Renowned for its authentic Italian recipes and commitment to quality, Slice Delight offers a wide variety of pizzas that cater to both traditional tastes and contemporary preferences. However, in recent years, Slice Delight has faced challenges in maintaining steady sales revenue. Despite a loyal customer base, fluctuations in sales patterns and increasing competition from new eateries in the area have impacted their financial performance. In response to these challenges, the pizzeria's management decided to hire a data analyst to gain deeper insights into their sales data. The objective was to answer critical questions about menu item popularity, pizza size popularity, peak business hour, revenue over time, ultimately aiming to develop strategies to boost revenue and streamline operations.
